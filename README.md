# Having Fun with Fizz Buzz

I came across this apparently common JavaScript interview puzzle regarding "FizzBuzz"

[FizzBuzz: One Simple Interview Question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc)

FizzBuzz is a game whereby two people count up in turn 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... saying the numbers.\
When one reaches a multiple of three, one says "Fizz" instead of the number;\
and when one reaches a multiple of five, one says "Buzz" instead of the number.\
Moreover, when it is a multiple of both i.e. 15, one says "FizzBuzz"

A gentleman by the name of [Imran Ghory](https://imranontech.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/) proposed that anyone going for a job in computer programming should be able to:

> **write a program that outputs the correct words according to "FizzBuzz" for the numbers 1 to 100.**

This generated some interesting results and essays - see the references for more information.

In my estimation, I managed to write a solution.

Being intrigued with FizzBuzz, I  wrote the following variations to "FizzBuzz":

## FizzBuzzV1
See [FizzBuzzV1](https://github.com/DelroyGayle/FizzBuzzV1) for further details.


## FizzBuzzV2 i.e. FizzBuzzPrimes

FizzBuzzPrimes is a React program which displays 100 buttons representing the range 1 to 100.\
Cyan buttons labelled "FizzBuzz" are shown for numbers that are multiples of 3 and 5\
i.e. multiples of 15

Orange buttons labelled 'Fizz' are shown for numbers that are multiples of 3\
Yellow buttons labelled 'Buzz' are shown for numbers that are multiples of 5\

However odd prime numbers are given randomly coloured buttons with a random word ending with two identical letters
